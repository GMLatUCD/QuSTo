# QuSTo : **Qu**antifying **S**urface **To**pography                                                       

QuSTo, a versatile, open-source program developed in Python to quantify surface topography from 2D profiles. The program calculates metrics that quantify surface roughness and the size (i.e. height and length) and shape (i.e. convexity constant (CC), skewness (Sk), and kurtosis (Ku)) of surface structures. Currently, QuSTo is available as a Windows executable, which neatly packs a python interpreter and the all the computational packages. 

## Using the code

1. Either clone the repository (https://github.com/GMLatUCD/QuSTo.git) or download the zip file to download the executable and six trial surfaces.
2. Please read the README_QuSTo file as it contains all the information regarding the background and usage of the code and accompanying trial surfaces.
3. Double click on QuSTov1.0final executable file to run the GUI. 

## Words of caution

1. As a onefile python executable it might take a few seconds to run the GUI, depending on the machine.
2. Please follow the exact procedure, defined in README_QuSTo, for a successful run as currently the code contains minimal debug error codes.

## Planned releases/improvements

1. The complete python code and compiled executable for Windows with faster runtime.
2. Additional filetypes for input file (txt,csv,xlsx)
3. Manual selection of the maxima and minima.
4. Automatic screen resizing based on screen size.
